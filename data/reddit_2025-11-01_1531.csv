Home,Are metal roofs actually worse than Asphalt (Northeast)?,"Photo unrelated. My 23 year old asphalt roof finally sprung a leak. Got a local roofer here to fix it. Seems reputable, about 180 5-star reviews on Google (and nothing less than 5 stars). He didn't even bother to try to sell me a new roof but I asked about one as he was leaving. 

He does both metal and asphalt but says asphalt is better for most people. Metal isn't worth the extra cost. It doesn't require yearly maintenance like metal he says. Something about screws or bolts shifting, where as asphalt has the nails under the shingles. Says only go metal if you like the look. Which I do prefer the metal look much more. But I also don't want more maintenance.

He uses shingles that have a 50 year warranty and he warranties his work itself for 20 years.

Does all this seem true and reasonable?

When we bought the house there was a LOT that needed to be updated. The previous owners cheaped out on everything. The roof is the one thing we’ve never had to worry about.

We have a giant mature pine tree next to us though that drops pinecones year-round and I don’t think a shingle roof could survive it. I think the best roof type for you depends on the type of weather and debris you’ll be dealing with on a regular basis though to decide if it’s worth it.

Edit: Also, I inspect our roof twice a year after major storms and I’ve never had to do maintenance on it. So, I’m not sure what he’s talking about with yearly maintenance. || A metal roof will out live your grand kids. Go with metal so you only pay once || 50 year shingles?? Has he discovered some sort of alien technology or something? 

Metal is always better, but much more expensive. || As I understand it metal roofs can last anywhere between 50-100 years whereas asphalt singles can last 20-30 years.  If you can afford a metal roof it's likely it will be up to your heirs or your heir heirs to get it replaced.",80,1761944068.0

NoStupidQuestions,Why do most people prefer to adopt babies/kids and never teenagers?,"I (F15) have been available for adoption since I was 12 years old and I doubt I will ever be adopted. I get good grades in school, I don't smoke, I don't like parties, I'm respectful, and it still doesn't make any difference. I will probably continue living with my foster mother until I turn 18.



This community is for curiosity, not karma farming.","This is going to be tough to read but it’s likely because babies and little kids just aren’t going to have as much potential baggage as a teen. You are your own person who’s already been shaped by experiences, while a baby can still be shaped by whoever raises them.

I hope you’re found by the right people. || I adopted 2 teenage children and one child when they were 7 and also work in the foster care field so may be able to share some insight. 

1. One of my biggest fears when adopting teens was that I would go out on a branch and love them with my whole heart and be rejected by them and basically just watch them run back to bio family when they were 18 and never hear from them again. I would feel devastated if that happened and working in foster care for many years I have seen many iterations of that because kids are trying to heal what happened to them. 

2. The truth is any kid who’s come into foster care has trauma and can have “issues”. The difference is when a 5 year old has a tantrum you can kind of help control it. When a 16 year old has a tantrum you  may end up with holes all in your walls and even being assaulted (both happened to me with one of our kiddos and it was some very scary years that I still carry scars from so many years later). So some people have a fear of safety issues.
3. Older kids who are in care have, in many cases, had to become very hardened to survive. Both my teen adopted kids were like this and it was very hard to connect with them and took so long for them to trust that when I said I wasn’t giving up on them I meant it. One of them never really did until years after adulthood. But…not many people want to or have the capacity to be constantly pushed away by someone until they could trust them. Both my teens had been in over 15 homes by the time they came to me and honestly some of the reasons they were kicked out were so ridiculous people just really don’t have the patience for older kids like they do younger and that really sucks. I actually felt even more connected to my teens when we came out of the other side of some of their big traumas cuz we walked their path of healing together.
4. Many foster parents have been burned by caseworkers lying to them about a foster child’s background or issues just to find that kid a bed so there is a mistrust some times for older kids that people aren’t always being told what kind of things could potentially be coming into their home with an older child.
5. Teen years are rough for any kid, but then add in all the hard stuff a foster teen has been through it can seem overwhelming to some. Many teens in care have been put in situations where they had to be their own parent) so when they get to an age where they feel like they already know how to take care of themselves (but usually there’s a lot of gaps in good decision making skills due to trauma) they resent a parent figure coming in and telling them, no actually you can’t stay out til whenever or listen to whatever or wear whatever or speak however. 

With all this being said, please do not give up hope. There are still people out there who want to adopt teens or maybe even a person who may not have thought about it but will cross paths with you and consider it. I personally loved adopting in the teen phase (not much a fan of babies lol) and I know there are people out there who have a heart for it. || Adopting teens is seen as more “risky”, what if they have problematic behavior and won’t change? Smoking, drugs, stealing, disrespect, or won’t accept the adoptive family as family, etc. While those risks aren’t so prevalent with babies and small children || I'm sorry for your hardships, and hope things work out well for you either way.

Your observation is valid.
A lot of people who adopt had hoped to have their own baby but could not, so they are trying to replicate that experience.

Also, teenagers are famously independent compared to little children, so raising teens may not provide the experience people were looking for.

Also, some people want to help form a child's personality and outlook and values, which are really pretty much set by the teen years. || One of my friends in high school was up for adoption and said he felt like a pit bull at the animal shelter.

Recent happenings - where we see nationalist/right wing governments display immense levels of stupidity, incompetence and even incoherence - make me wonder whether Nazi Germany saw similar things as they descended into fascism?

I'd like to think I know the average amount of information of how the Nazis came into power - and I don't recall anything like this. 
","Well I don’t know if this is controversial thing to say but I think they’re not totally disciplined I think all those parades, uniform and etc are all just propaganda because war is also about intimidation.

There’s also a lot of backstabbing, rivalry between different departments like the SS and Wehrmacht, just a massive corrupt bureaucracy hiding behind the curtain || The Nazi party started in a beer hall. For the first few years, everyone was drunk at all the meetings. The nazis a launched coup called “the beer hall putsch” in 1923, with 2000men, they retreated rather quickly after the shooting started. It would be that failed coup attempt, that gave Hitler the name recognition necessary to take power peacefully. Hitler was also addicted to both meth and heroine and a lot of Nazi tend to use a lot of substances. The difference with the Nazis, is that there wasn’t the internet to immediately broadcast all their stupidity and they had excellent story-teller in the name of Joseph Goebells to make everything seem a lot cleaner, more badass and more efficient || I would rather answer this question with a very nuanced yes to the second part: they were also full of contradictions and hypocrisy.

On the one hand, yes, like modern-day Germany: a highly organized and stratified system. The Wehrmacht and the SS in particular were known for their blind obedience to orders and rigorous training. On the other hand, as in modern-day Germany, it was not uncommon for systems to compete with each other due to over-organization, and coordination between them often failed. Albert Speer himself spoke of the immaculate showcase that was displayed to the outside world and how chaotic the backroom was in reality. And the fact that they served a totalitarian regime led by a drug-addict psycho meant that many decisions were made on the basis of favoritism and loyalty rather than on true merit or what was really best for the country rather than for the Führer. 

The idea of the German state being highly efficient is a myth that persists today because it has its good roots in the Prussian state. The Nazis took advantage of this, and in today's Germany, one realizes that it is rather a myth than reality. || In my region we have a saying that translates to “Is he just stupid or actually on our side?” where we wonder wether some of the Nazi soldiers who occupied us were incompetent, or if it was a form of rebellion against the reigh.

How do three soldiers who had to guard a bridge, collectively decide to go for lunch at the same restaurant at the same time every day? They are leaving it unguarded!  Is it incompetence, sloth, arrogance, anti Nazi sentiment, did they think “if we leave the rebellion an opening for crossing the bridge then they won’t need to attack us and we stay alive” or something similar? We will never truly know what went on in their minds. || Both, in a way. Nazi germany was well-industrialized and organized, which extended even to their systematic murder and genocide of ""undesirables"" such as jew, sinti/roma, the disabled, slaws and so on. after the chaos of the weimar republic (fueled by WW1 reparations, inflation and staggering unemployment), what the nazis offered seemed to be stability and order.

but then again, beneath the surface, there absolutely was petty bickering, politicking, backstabbing, hypocrisy and incompetence: one of the reason the nazis brought an economic upswing was that they simply [stole stuff](https://www.richardjevans.com/lectures/corruption-plunder-third-reich/). government ministries often had rivalries due to (sometimes deliberately placed) overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities. this sort of competition seems to be aimed at promoting ambition and a ""might makes right"" approach - consistent with nazi ideology - but it also caused massive friction and wasted government ressources.

as for the discipline of their soldiers: they were a competent standing army that, through combined arms (a cutting edge new tactic at the time) crushed much of the other european armies. but they also used [Panzerschokolade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine#History,_society,_and_culture), literally ""tank chocolate"" as a stimulant for their troops - which was just meth. a far cry from the propaganda poster of the honourable (another lie, the wehrmacht was deeply involved in war crimes) soldier fighting the good fight.

In summary: they absolutely were competent and organized - they wouldn't have had the success they had otherwise. but they were also deeply corrupt and ideologically inconsistent. they were regular people, with all the quirks and follies that comes with that. that is why it's so important to study them - because regular people can become monsters if the conditions are ""right"".",199,1761989258.0

NoStupidQuestions,Why does building credit feel like a scam for people who’ve never even been in debt?,"I’ve never missed a payment in my life. I pay my rent on time, cover my bills early, have no loans, and keep my finances clean. Yet somehow, I’m “not trustworthy” enough for a decent credit score. Like… what? How does that even make sense?

It blows my mind how the system works. You can be completely financially responsible but if you don’t have a credit card or loan history, you basically don’t exist to lenders. It’s wild how being debt-free doesn’t mean you have good credit, it means you have *no* credit. The logic feels so backwards.

I tried applying for a new apartment recently and the leasing office straight-up told me my “thin credit file” was an issue. I literally had to explain that I’ve never missed a payment because I don’t use credit cards. The lady smiled and said, “Yeah, that’s the problem.” Like… how do you fix that without falling into the trap of borrowing money just to prove you can pay it back?

I started digging around and learned that there are actually debit cards that report to credit bureaus and help you build credit while using your own money. It honestly feels like the one adulting hack no one ever told us about, a way to grow your credit history without taking on loans or juggling interest payments. It makes so much more sense than jumping straight into traditional credit cards when you’re just starting out.

It’s kind of crazy that we’re all just trying to figure this stuff out on our own. Credit feels like one of those things that everyone needs but nobody really understands until it bites them.","Credit scores predict how you handle credit, so if you've never had a tradeline, there's nothing to score. Rent and utlities usually don't report, which makes you look invisible.

The easiest fix is to open a no-fee secured card or a credit-builder line that reports to all bureaus, put one recurring bill on it, and auto-pay in full. 

Those debit-style builders can work too, just watch fees and make sure they actually report. || What I did was open a credit card, put all my expenses and spending on it, and paid it in full every month. By she 26 I had a 800 credit score || The logic feels backwards to you.   Please try to look at it from their point of view:

We want to know if these 3 customers will repay the loan. Each is asking for a $30,000 car loan.

Customer 1:  has taken many loans, has failed to repay some of them on time, and defaulted on others. : we lost money

Customer 2: has taken many loans, and repaid all of them per the financing agreement.  : We like this one because we got all the money back and made a profit on interest 

Customer 3:  has not borrowed any money, so we don’t know if he will pay us back. :  we will go find more clients like #2 ||  The credit system doesn’t measure how responsible you are with money, it measures how well you handle debt. If you’ve never borrowed, lenders have no “proof” of how you’d act with borrowed money, so they treat you like an unknown risk.

That’s why people with no loans or credit cards often end up with “no credit,” not “good credit.” It’s less about logic and more about how the system’s built, for banks, not consumers. Using debit cards that report to credit bureaus or secured credit cards is basically the loophole to build credit without actually going into debt. || Credit isn’t really about creditworthiness. All it is is an indicator of how good a customer you can be to lending institutions.",55,1762003886.0

A wa ka, mu mone; kambei ya le’i; lii i lei ka

Haa so wolingoh sia kpande wilei

Haa so wolingoh, ndohoh lii, nde kee

Haa so wolingoh sia kuhama ndee yia

Translated into English, the lyrics read:

Everyone come together, let us struggle; the grave is not yet finished; let his heart be perfectly at peace.

Everyone come together, let us struggle; the grave is not yet finished; let his heart be very much at peace.

Sudden death commands everyone’s attention like a firing gun.

Sudden death commands everyone’s attention, oh elders, oh heads of the family.

Sudden death commands everyone’s attention like a distant drumbeat. || Legit made me tear up. I studied history and this type of thing is just so amazing. I can’t imagine the pain and longing that these people have endured. || See dad!!! Ethnomusicology IS an important major!!!!

This was really cool to watch. || Smithsonian article: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-memory-of-a-song-reunited-two-women-separated-by-the-trans-atlantic-slave-trade-180983864/ || That's the power of oral culture through generations, especially since slaveholders and Southern society kept most slaves illiterate.

i´ve started building a rescue squad for raid bosses.
