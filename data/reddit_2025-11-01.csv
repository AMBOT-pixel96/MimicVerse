Home,Are metal roofs actually worse than Asphalt (Northeast)?,"Photo unrelated. My 23 year old asphalt roof finally sprung a leak. Got a local roofer here to fix it. Seems reputable, about 180 5-star reviews on Google (and nothing less than 5 stars). He didn't even bother to try to sell me a new roof but I asked about one as he was leaving. 

He does both metal and asphalt but says asphalt is better for most people. Metal isn't worth the extra cost. It doesn't require yearly maintenance like metal he says. Something about screws or bolts shifting, where as asphalt has the nails under the shingles. Says only go metal if you like the look. Which I do prefer the metal look much more. But I also don't want more maintenance.

He uses shingles that have a 50 year warranty and he warranties his work itself for 20 years.

Does all this seem true and reasonable?


Also, I haven't had him out to give me a quote yet but what are you all seeing for roof price lately on a 2700SF two story home with a 32x40 detached garage?","Well, a metal roof done well by craftsman, alike a copper roof, doesn't have screws. And lasts a century or so. But likely not what he delivers. 

Personally, as roofs come, I look for a craftsman based on the style of a house. If you have a simple house asphalt will do fine. || I love our metal roof. When we bought the house there was a LOT that needed to be updated. The previous owners cheaped out on everything. The roof is the one thing we’ve never had to worry about.

We have a giant mature pine tree next to us though that drops pinecones year-round and I don’t think a shingle roof could survive it. I think the best roof type for you depends on the type of weather and debris you’ll be dealing with on a regular basis though to decide if it’s worth it.

Edit: Also, I inspect our roof twice a year after major storms and I’ve never had to do maintenance on it. So, I’m not sure what he’s talking about with yearly maintenance. || 50 year shingles?? Has he discovered some sort of alien technology or something? 

Metal is always better, but much more expensive. || A few years ago I visited a church in WI that was built in the 1880’s and still has the original metal roof || As I understand it metal roofs can last anywhere between 50-100 years whereas asphalt singles can last 20-30 years.

Home,Basement Window Question,"Hey all! We currently have double slider lift and remove windows in the basement. Problem is, when the rain hits from a certain angle, it leaks in between the window sections and into the house. 

We’re looking to replace the windows as window well covers have to be custom sized and are almost just as expensive as a new window. 

My question is, will all sliders leak in time? One company said yes, one said only because ours were currently builder grade. 

Our window wells are 22 deep. Window is approximately 33 high and about 42 wide. Pictures are from before we cleaned the entire windows and tracks

","Are you sure it was well above average pay, or just regular pay for Hawaii? || You probably would be living paycheck to paycheck there.

We cooked a bunch, shopped at Costco, and rarely ate out. I only saved enough money for a $10k rainy day fund, then everything extra I had went to paying off our student loans and retirement savings.

BaldursGate3,Ascended Astarion,"So, I'm a big fan of this game, with about 700 hours in it. And there's is a constant discourse about Ascended Astarion being his good ending. I've romanced him 3 times and decided to ascend him for the first time in the run where I was romancing Wyll. 

And honestly, I was blown away by the differences - they were drastic, and now I can't imagine why some people think that's ascension is his good ending. Not only his face is twisted with a grimace beyond recognition during the ritual, but immediately after it he starts rambling about how the world will bend to his knees. Mind you, broski didn't even say a simple 'thank you' to us that we helped him defeat Cazador, his lackeys and that we were Astarion's 'eyes' so that he could complete the ritual. Even Lae'zel, who has a culture with no words of gratitude in it (which she mentions in the dialogue after you save her from Orin) takes time to express her gratitude. 

Several long rests after, a ! pops up above his head. Turns out, bro just wanted to talk about how powerful he is and how the world is too slow and can't catch up to him anymore. What was more interesting, that I've picked a dialogue option, that says something along the lines of 'so one tyrant replaces another', and Astarion straight up confirms that he's just like Cazador now, and that he's not ashamed of it. 

Sorry, if i spent your time stating the obvious, but I am still stunned after what I've seen. Like, I knew that Astarion becomes a jerk, I've just never seen to which extent.","I romanced him in my embrace Durge playthrough and I let him ascend. The ick I felt afterwards during the ""romance"" dialogue...So I took the brain for Bhaal and gave Astarion a farewell kiss *wink*. Felt so good! Ascended Astarion is a piece of sh*t. || Astarion himself thanks the player for stopping him, acknowledging that if he had gone ahead with the Rite, he’d become a bigger asshole than Cazador and 7000x more powerful. || Where did you even read/hear that Ascended is a good ending? Because it's not, and practically consensus over the community that it's a bad ending. || It’s straight up his bad ending. It’s just, he’s written like a narcissistic abuser, and just like real narcissistic abusers, it’s easy to get caught up in the idea of “I’m special, he’d never hurt me, he loves me” if you’re vulnerable to that kind of abuse. That’s why you’ll get such zealous defenders.

I myself preferred ascended Astarion, but then I eventually had to deal with the reality that my ex was exactly that type of controlling, and that I was groomed to be submissive, use sex transactionally, and enjoy my boundaries being violated. There are some out there who are probably going through similar types of abuse and don’t want to deal with the introspection that comes with admitting AA is abusive.

Edit: There is also the fantasy of wanting to see the victim get to win and be the new one in power / control because lots of victims have power and control fantasies themselves. But again, people tend to imagine the team instead of it being Astarion on top and their character just being to him what he was to Cazador. || I let him ascend and then I noped the fuck out, reloaded, and stopped that shit.

interestingasfuck,"To educated the masses - ""Don't be a sucker"" by the United States Army Signal Corps (1945)",,"To those who think modern society is Fascism-proof, here’s a highly-relevant firsthand account from a German who lived through the rise of Fascism. From the book *They Thought They Were Free* by Milton Mayer:

""To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it, unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness than most of us ever had occasion to develop. Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, ‘regretted’, that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these ‘little measures’ that ‘no patriotic German’ could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.

From there, one doesn’t see exactly where or how to move. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not? Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.

Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. In your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’

And you *are* an alarmist. You are saying that *this* must lead to *this*, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.

But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. *That’s* the difficulty. **If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked**. If, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. **But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.**

And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. **Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.**” || Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace

\- Rod Serling talking about fascism || I find curious that this propaganda film doesnt want to make you angry because ""nazis are american rivals and are bad because we do not support them"", no, it tells you that fascism is harmful for the society because its full of prejudice, and its not said by the perspective of an american, but from the point of view from a hungarian immigrant that lived in the 3rd Reich Germany (well, he has the us citizenship but you understand my point).

^(*This is an automated comment*) || People have been doing meet and greets for years and they already solved this problem. It's called a table. you have the streamer on one side of a table, and the people come talk to them with a table between them. If you want a picture, you get an awkward pose, but at least there is separation. I don't know why Twitch insists on just having them standing there like open targets. || Nick's correct to a point, but you need to expand that logic. If someone is willing to risk a lot to get close to a streamer then there is nothing you can do:

1. Have a security guard right there so the attacker knows they are going to get tackled if they do it.

2. Have a secure line with background/identity checks. So they know you will find them if they do anything.

3. RSVP so they need to think about what they are planning, and not just a nut job spur of the moment running at the streamer.

Plus a lot more I am sure a professional security company could think of. I am not sure what Nick's point was saying you can not stop them. No you can not stop someone that is willing to give up everything, but that does not mean that there is nothing Twitch can do. || I feel like everyone is missing the real issue of what happened to Emiru, she didn’t need 20 body guards, she just needed 1 who was vigilant and willing to physical intervene when the dude started making a V line to her, twitch hired non professionals to be security, these guys were not ready to step in like they should have been || Hang on.. putting shock collars on fans might actually work.",1358,1761913390.0

Fashion is the true endgame, right? || Being able to go underwater and explore underwater areas with pals that can dive. Likewise maybe some sky areas to explore as well with pals that can soar high.
